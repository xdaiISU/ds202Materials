## Outline

- Optionally, team up with at most two partners from your study group
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to your teammate(s)
- Explore data on chocolate ratings
- Create R markdown files that contain code to read the data and create the plots
- Submit!


## Background

Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, obviously likes chocolate. He has assembled a database of ratings for plain dark chocolate bars: [Flavors of chocolate](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html). 
By now, over 2300 different chocolate bars have been rated. 

### Meaning of ratings

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

- 4.0 - 5.0   = Outstanding
- 3.5 - 3.9   = Highly Recommended
- 3.0 - 3.49 = Recommended
- 2.0 - 2.9   = Disappointing
- 1.0 - 1.9   = Unpleasant

### Reading the data

The file `choco.csv` at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/data/choco.csv is a web scrap from the chocolate flavor data base.

You can load the data into your session using the command below:

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/data/choco.csv") 
str(choco) 
```

## Searching for the Best Chocolates

We will be exploring what aspects of the chocolates may affect taste. Before setting off to the exploration, answer the following questions.

1. How are the ratings distributed? Create both a histogram and a boxplot and describe them. Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
2. How does the number of ratings depend on the location of the company? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
3. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain. [Hint: Think about why the scatterplot is *not* a very good choice for visualization here.]

  Now, we are ready to explore.

4. How do different bean origins compare in terms of the flavor of chocolates? Are beans from some places better than the other? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain. 
5. Brainstorm *two* analyses you would like to perform (with your teammates). Describe in plain language what comparisons are you making. Create suitable numerical and graphical summaries for your analyses. Describe the results.

## Collaboration Workflow

### Overview
1. **Discuss with your teammate plans for the analyses.**
1. **Include your own analysis in an individual file.** This file is the "scratch file", which should include all your own exploration and analysis, even if you would not show those results in your final report. Name your own file as either `individual1.Rmd`, `individual2.Rmd`, or `individual3.Rmd` after coordinating with your teammate(s), if you have.
2. **After you have decided the exploration/analysis to show in your report,  collaborate on a single `team.Rmd` file which includes the final analysis.** Only the `team.Rmd` and the knitted `team.html` files will be graded, even if you are working on this lab by yourself. 

### Recap: Collaborating on a GitHub repository

**Individual 1:**

1. Log into github, and create a repository called `ds202_lab2`
2. Go into the settings of the repository and add your team member as a collaborator
3. Push `individual1.Rmd` and `individual1.html` to the remote.

When the above is finished, **Individual 2:**

1. Log into GitHub and accept the invitation to work on the team repo.
1. Clone the remote repo of Individual 1's.
2. Add `individual2.Rmd` and `individual2.html` to the local repo, and push.

(Repeat if there is a third teammate)

### Working on the `team.Rmd`
1. One of the teammates will make a draft `team.Rmd`, include the file in a git commit, and then push to the remote. 
2. The other teammate will pull, make additions and modifications to `team.Rmd`, create a commit, and then push.
3. Repeat as necessary. 

### Repo structure
The git repo of your team should be named ds202_lab2. Use the same folder structure and file names as follows:

```
ds202_lab2
|-- individual1.Rmd
|-- (individual2.Rmd)
|-- (individual3.Rmd)
|-- team.Rmd
|-- *.html files
```

### Tips:
- You can start from Invididual 1 adding and pushing `team.Rmd`, and then Individual 2 `git pull`
- Before you make changes to existing files or `git push`, remember to `git pull` first
- Coorindate with your teammate to avoid merge conflict
- Ask for help on Piazza if you come across problems
- If you work in a team, then all `Rmd` and the knitted `html` files for the individuals and the team are required. All teammates must modify `team.Rmd` (you can check this is done using `git log team.Rmd` in `bash`).
