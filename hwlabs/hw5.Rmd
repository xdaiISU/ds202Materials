4. First overview: Provide a visual breakdown of the liquor category (by `Category Name`). Include volume sold in the breakdown. Describe your figure. Which type of liquor is the most popular?

5. Which day of the week has the most orders? Use a barchart to visualize the results. Explain the pattern and provide a reason why the pattern occurs.

6. We would like to compare the liquor orders in each month. Create a complex time series plot of the volume sold in each day. Each month should be shown in a separate panel. Label the day of the week for the x-axis tick labels. Which months have more orders than the others?

7. Create a single time series plot for the monthly volumes sold. Each liquor category should be shown using a separate line. Label the top 5 categories using text labels.
