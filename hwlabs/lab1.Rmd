## Overview 

In this lab, you and your teammate will collaborate on a GitHub repository. Part I will be finished individually. When we come to part II, you will form pairs within your study group. If your study group has an odd number of students you can work in a team of 3 students, and will rotate your roles. 

## Part I: Working with Git and GitHub

### Creating Your Local Git repo
In Homework one, you were asked to put the homework files in the `ds202_hw1` directory. Now make the directory a local Git repo. 
<!-- You will need the following commands (in Terminal): `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`.  -->

1. Initialize the directory `ds202_hw1` as a git repository. In `bash` (in the Terminal tab in RStudio),
    i) `cd` into that folder (If you have done this correctly, `pwd` will show something like `/Users/xdai/ds202_hw1`; the last part of the path must be `ds202_hw1`)
    ii) `git status` should show report `Not a git repository`
    iii) Run `git init`
2. Create a commit which includes the RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` and the output `hw1.html`. Use a meaningful commit message.
    i) Stage the files using `git add hw1.Rmd hw1.html`
    ii) Commit the files with a message `git commit -m 'Your Message Here'
3. Check that `git` is doing what you want it to do
    i) Use `git status` to make sure `hw1.Rmd` and `hw1.html` are not untracked, and 
    ii) `git log` to make sure a commit is made.
    
So far, you have a local Git repo (sitting on your laptop/desktop) containing your HW1! </span>

### Pushing Homework to a Remote Repository

**Step 1, create a remote repository on Github**. Follow along the instructions below and perform these steps:

1. Log in your account on [Github](https://github.com)
2. Create a new Github repository, click <span style="background:limegreen; color:white">New</span> button.
3. Name your repository `ds202_hw1`; leave it a public repository.
4. Click <span style="background:limegreen; color:white">Create repository</span> button.
5. Don't close the browser tab! We will need it later.

So far, 

- You have created a remote repository on GitHub. The remote repository is ready to store your existing local repository.
- Once the repository is created you will be directed to the repository page which now has its own web address. 
-  Each repository on Github has a unique url (containing your username and the repo name), so you can easily share. 
- The remote repo is empty when first created. We will push our local repo to the remote.
<!--
-  The git history is a detailed history of all the changes made to that file.  One of the features of using Github is the ability to view your repository history which are displayed in the Graphs section of your Github repository page. 
-  At this point in the git history of your `lab1-your-gitname` repository there is only one commit.
-->

**Step 2 Push the existing local repo to the remote**. Follow along with your instructor and perform these steps:

1. Go back to the GitHub browser tab. 

2. Copy the commands that come after **â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line**

3. Go back to `bash`, and paste in the commands.

    Here, 

- `git remote add origin https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/ds202_hw1.git` tells git that a remote repository can be found on the URL you specify; name the remote `origin`
- `git push -u origin master` tells `git` to push your local changes; `-u origin master` means the local branch `master` should track future changes in the same branch on the remote `origin`.

4. Succeeded? Refresh the webpage for your repo on GitHub and see the changes.


## Part II: Collaborating on a Repository

Now you will collaborate on and make change to a partner's repo. Form pairs within your study group. One of you is the Owner of a repo, and the other is the Partner who collaborates on the same repo. You will rotate roles and complete Part II again when you are done. 

**Step 1**: Locate the remote repo you will be collaborating on. 

1. Owner: Share the url of your repo with the Partner.
2. Partner: Visit the url, and make sure you can see all the files (have read access). Tell the Owner what did he/she do in the most recent commit. Tell the Owner your username. 
3. Owner: Give the Partner push (write) access to your repo. On the webpage of the repo, click Settings -- Collaborators -- type in the Partner's username -- click Add collaborator

**Step 2**: The Partner will make a local clone of the Owner's remote repo and add changes.

1. Partner: Clone the Owner's repo:
    i) On GitHub, find the repo URL by clicking <span style="background:limegreen; color:white"> Code</span>  button. Make sure you are cloning with HTTPS, so that the url starts with `https://`. if not, click <span style="color:#0366d6"> Use HTTPS</span>. Now copy the URL.
    i) In  `bash`, `cd` into a **non-git directory** to store the Owner's repo. Check that `git status` should report "Not a git repository".
    i) In `bash`, issue 
    
        ```
        git clone URL ds202_hw1_owner
        ```
      
        with the URL being the copied URL. We are making a new local directory named `ds202_hw1_owner`
    i) `cd` into the cloned folder.
    
    So far, the Partner has a local copy of the Owner's repo, and in bash the working directory is the cloned repo.
    
2. Partner: Create a new Rmd file in the repo, and name it `partner.Rmd`. 

3. Partner: Modify `partner.Rmd` to include the following information. Knit it when finished.

    - Your (the Partner's) full name and GitHub username. 
    - What did the Owner do in the most recent commit? What is the commit ID?
    - Knit the Owner's `hw1.Rmd`. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you counter?
    - Also include an error/difficulty you encountered, or a tip for making Git/GitHub easier.

4. Partner: Add `partner.Rmd` and `partner.html` to the local git repo and make a new commit (you need `git add` and `git commit -m '...'`).  

5. Partner: Pull updates (if any) from GitHub, and then push your changes to the remote repo (of the Owner's), using 
  ```
  git pull
  git push
  ```

**Step 3**: To finish the collaboration,

1. Owner: See if your repo is updated on GitHub.

2. Owner: Pull updates from GitHub to your local version, by
    ```
    git pull
    ```

3. Owner: View the Partner's change on your local repo using `git diff`.

You have completed a cycle of collaboration. Congratulations! **Now the Owner and Partner switch role and repeat Part II.** 

## Summary for Collaboration on GitHub
1. The Owner pushes his/her local repo  to a  remote repo on GitHub, and gives the Partner access to the remote.
2. The Partner clones (or pull from) the Owner's GitHub repo, makes local changes, commits, and then pushes.
3. The Owner updates his/her local repo by `git pull` in order to obtain the changes made by the Partner. 

## Submission

Submission: Each student should submit the HTTPS URL of their own repository on Canvas. In the submission note, include the full name and github username of the partner who made changes to your repo.

## Grading
You will be graded based on your own repository. Since it includes your Partner's changes, make sure to help out your partner and check the teamwork.
