## What is Git?

- `git` is a *version control system* that is created to help developers track changes in source codes and manage collaborative projects. 
`git` tracks the evolution of a folder containing code files and subfolders. 
<!-- The tracked folder is called a **repository** or **repo**.  -->
- `git` helps us
    - *make records* of the code files, creating snapshots
    - *compare* snapshots to locate changes or bugs
    - *rollback* to previous versions of files as necessary
    - store *master* and multiple versions of files, no more `paper_final_final_I_really_mean_it.docx`
    - *merge* versions and *resolve conflicts* that arise from collaboration


## `bash` Command-Line.

- To use `git`, we will be accessing the command-line tools in `bash`
- We can access `bash` in the Terminal tab in RStudio. Homework 1 instructs you how to set this up
- `bash` command line is a text-based interface to your operating system
- The most important `bash` commands are: 
    - `pwd`, present working directory. All relative paths are relative to the present working directory.
    - `ls`, list files; `ls -a`, list all files including hidden ones
    - `cd`, change directory
- Other important commands: `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `open`

<!-- **<span style="color:white"> Exploring bash command line </span>** -->

<!-- <span style="color:white"> If you are on Windows, you need to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and configure RStudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal. See Homework 1 question 4. </span> -->

2. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> In RStudio, click the Terminal tab (right to the Console tab).</span>
3. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Find the present working directory?</span>
4. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Create a new directory named `example1`, and then `cd` into this directory. </span>
5. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Create an RMarkDown file named 'tmp.Rmd' in RStudio and knit it. Move it into `example1` in Bash. Also move the generated html file.</span>
6. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Use `open` to view the content of the html file in Bash.</span>

## Git 

Terminology from [github glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

- **Repository:** the basic element of `git` - like a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files, and their __revision history__. 
- **Commit:** A checkpoint, i.e., snapshot of the codes files at a time point. Every time you commit, git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by whom.

`git` commands important to us: `git init`, `git status`, `git log`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git diff`.

Caution: `git` works well with text files but not binary files

<!-- ## Looking ahead ...  -->

<!-- In this class we will use git & github for  -->

<!-- - homework and lab assignments, and -->
<!-- - the projects. -->

## Your turn: Making git commits  {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

1. <span style="color:white"> <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make `example1` your current directory. </span>
2. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Initiate the current directory as a Git repository (`git init`). What does `git status` show? </span>
3. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Ask Git to track the RMarkDown file and create a commit (`git add fileName`, and then `git commit -m 'Your Message Here'`).</span>
4. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Repeat part 3 for the html file.</span>
5. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Look at the repo status (`git status`) and repo history (`git log`)</span>
