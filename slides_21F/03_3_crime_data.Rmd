## Looking at data {.shout}

## Data Exploration

- asking good questions is important for any data exploration: "your data won't speak unless you ask the right questions"
- a data exploration is a cycle of asking questions, looking at the answers, and deriving new questions from them
- for a sound exploration: start by checking individual variables, and then move on to higher dimensions

## An example exploration {.shout}



## Your turn {.white}


<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

<span style="color:white">
Write down questions that you could answer with this data 4 minutes by yourself, and then pair up for another 3 minutes. We'll project your ideas</span>

```{r}
library(classdata)
str(cities)
```


## Plan for answers

- Explore how one (or more) variables are distributed: *histogram, boxplot, or barplot*
- Explore how two variables are related:  *scatterplot, boxplot, tile plot*
- Explore how two variables are related, considering other variables: *color & other symbols*
- Explore trends

We will be using the basic R graphics today for plotting, which is amazingly flexible!

## Your turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

1. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> 
Draw a scatterplot of the number of burglaries by murders.</span>
2. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> 
Adjust the numbers of the above scatterplot to show log transformed numbers. </span>
3. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Draw a scatterplot of the log transformed number of burglaries by motor vehicle thefts using only data for 2016.</span>
3. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Are larger cities or smaller cities more dangerous in 2016?</span>
4. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
State a question. Use R graphics to answer it.</span>
5. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Repeat above.</span>
