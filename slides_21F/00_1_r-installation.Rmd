## Installing R

- Go to http://www.r-project.org/
- From CRAN, click `download R` and select download site (the ISU mirror is good): https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/
- Pick the download specific to your platform
- Follow the installation instructions to install the base version of R


## Installing RStudio

Download the **free** version of RStudio Desktop from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Getting ready for class

Open RStudio. In the console, type:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will trigger a slew of installs. Check the logs for any error messages that need to be addressed individually.

No errors? You're all set for **R**!
